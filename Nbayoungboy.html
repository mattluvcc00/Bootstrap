        He knows the trials of teenager and been through all the possible experiences of it. To the bad times like broken hearts and gang influence, to the good times like being with friends and knowing the next move after relationships. He 
        also tells gus fans to get a real job and do not be involve with violence. Us as fans seen what the thug life can lead to due to nba youngboy but the fact that he tells us not to do and knows 
        almost every possible teen experience like the ones I have mmetion and more like dealing with the lost of friends and family, and drug problems makes him the goat. He expresses everything in his music and he earns my respect for that. Nbayoungboy also joins Drake with being the only artist this year(2022) to have 2 billion streams</b></p>
